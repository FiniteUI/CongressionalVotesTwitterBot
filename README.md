# Congressional Votes Twitter Bot

**_Due to changes to the Twitter API, as well as the shutdown of the ProPublica API, the bot is not currently running._**

This is a small personal project to build a twitter bot to post whenever congress makes a vote. 

The project utilizes the ProPublic API to gather vote and bill information, and uses the twitter python package to make posts to twitter.

The bot makes an initial tweet with the vote number, description, and result. It replies to this in a thread with additional voting information, the twitter handle of the sponsor, a link to the full vote details, a link to the bill on the congress website, and a few other useful links to get more information.
